# House_Price_Predection_portfolio
This Project is from kaggle challenge 
•	Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques.
•	Tools/Libraries: Utilized notebook, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, calendar, CategoricalDtypes from pandas.api.types, and StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
•	Steps:
•	Loaded and integrated dataset from Kaggle competition.
•	Explored data, gained insights into numerical features.
•	Handled missing values using domain knowledge and statistical imputation.
•	Converted categorical features to numerical using one-hot encoding.
•	Split data into training and testing sets.
•	Trained multiple models and evaluated using cross-validation.
•	Saved predictions in a CSV file.
